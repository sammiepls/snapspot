# SnapSpot

An app created as my final project for Next Academy's bootcamp. See it here: https://snapspot-next.herokuapp.com/ 

This project was created in a week and is not currently actively maintained so apologies for any bugs!

## What is it?

An app for photographers to share their favorite spots to take photos at. Hence the name, **SnapSpot**. Photographers can add the latitude & longitude of their go-to places for photography, add descriptions, tag them and like other snapspots. They can search for new spots to take photos at using the main search in the home page or filter by tags. 

## Built with:

- Ruby on Rails
- Geocoder gem + GoogleMaps API
- Bootstrap (but customized)
